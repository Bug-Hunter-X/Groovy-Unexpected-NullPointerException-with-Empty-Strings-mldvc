This example demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to how empty strings are handled in comparisons.  The `myMethod` function correctly handles a null input but throws a `NullPointerException` when an empty string is passed. This is because Groovy's loose typing can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.  The solution involves explicitly checking for both null and empty strings.
